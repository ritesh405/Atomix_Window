Atomix Game for Windows
=======================
Atomix is a fun puzzle game with inventive education twist:
your task is to combine atoms to form the required chemical molecule, (e.g. 2 Hydrogen atoms and Oxygen for water) by sliding the atoms around.
Each level also has a time limit in addition to the various obstacles you must maneuver around or avoid. Overall, it's a novel combination of puzzle and education that should satisfy both camps
The tile-based playing field contains a number of atom blocks, as well as walls.
A side screen contains a small preview window showing what each molecule should look like.


How to play :
The player can move an atom around by selecting it, and moving it up, down, left, or right.
The catch is that, when moving, an atom block will not stop moving until it hits a wall or another atom block.
Even if it is the last atom to complete the molecule, it will keep moving past the almost complete molecule.
Since it is not possible to stop anything in mid-movement, it requires careful planning to align all blocks properly. Of course, each level has a strict time limit.
By completing each level within a certain time limit  the score of player will also increase .

Levels
The first level is water (H2O) with three atoms in a horizontal layout.
The second is methane (CH4) in a cross-shape.
Further levels use increasingly large and complex molecules, many with diagonal links which are harder to make. If the player runs out of time ,the game ends
First 5 levels are listed below.
•	1 - Water   	( H2O )
•	2 - Methane  	( CH4 )
•	3 - Methanol 	( CH3OH  )
•	4 - Ethene 	( C2H6 )
•	5 - Propene 	( C3H8 )
